### To do:
### NEED:
GENERAL
IMPLEMENT THE LOGIN SYSTEM
maybe using php

ADMIN DASHBOARD:
FIX THE TABLE (Recent Orders)
--- the 5 showing on preview table and
whole showing on the table of the orderspage
--- QUICK ACTIONS BUTTONS
--- when we click the addnewproduct button and add a new product, it should +1 actually the number of total products

PRODUCT DASHBOARD
--- MAKE A NEW DB FOR STOCKS OF EACH PRODUCTS OF EACH CATEGORIES
e.g mainDishes: chickenjoy: 50 
mga ganon
--- also kapag kunwari may order na 5pc chickenjoy therefore magsshow sa total sold is 5 which means order = sold so if there is no order yet, the total sold must show 0
--- if possible, make it automatically that when someone order 5 chicken then -5 sa current stock or decrement automatically
--- make the database work when we add a new product, it would show in the product html even if we refresh the page since it is already in db
--- also if possible that when we add a new product, it would also show sa orderMenuHTML

ORDER DASHBOARD:
---MAKE THE DB TABLE SHOW ALL THE TOTAL ORDER HISTORY
--- also implemented the function of those button(VIEW and EDIT)

CUSTOMER DASHBOARD:
- make a db for the costumer for holder when someone logs in
--- make the info of each customer dynamic that its info as well as its pfp depends on the input when logging in
